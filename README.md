## Rules
The rules are as in chess, apart from three exceptions:

   * No turns! Each player can make a move at anytime.
   * Each piece has a "cool-down": Once a piece has been moved, it cannot move again for five seconds.
   * Castling and En Passant are not allowed (but pawns can move two spaces forward on their first move).
